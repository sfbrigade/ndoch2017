          National Day of Civic Hacking
        </a> 
        is an international event for people to focus on improving their community. Thousands of people 
        from around the world will tackle civic-oriented projects around open data, disaster 
        relief, mapping, safety and justice, economic development, and other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Here in San Francisco,</strong> we are focusing on how to the city 
        can stay resilient in the face of disaster (natural and human-made). Code for San Francisco is partnering with the 
        <strong><a href="http://empowersf.org/">Neighborhood Empowerment Network (NEN)</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://sfdem.org">San Francisco Department of Emergency Management (SFDEM)</a></strong> 
        to bring an engaging program that will allow participants to learn and experience the ways the City is working 
        with communities to be prepared and connected. NEN will do this with an immersive, interactive exercise that
        will have people on their feet and learning by doing.
      </p>

      <p>
          With Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the 8.0 earthquake off the coast of Mexico, and even the recent heat wave in the Bay Area, we are being constantly reminded of how important recovery and resiliency is in a world with increasing threats, both natural and human-driven. Being prepared is something we all can contribute to. Join us in making San Francisco a more resilient city.

      <h2>Program: A Resilient City</h2>
      <p>
        On Saturday, September 23rd, the Neighborhood Empowerment Network (NEN) and San Francisco Department of Emergency Management (SFDEM) will give an overview of 
        resiliency efforts happening in San Francisco and lead a tabletop exercise with participants.
      </p>
      <p>We'll kickoff the day with an introduction and keynote by Megan Georing to set the tone and wrap time for 
        prototyping, hacking and networking. We'll bring all the great ideas and energy back to our weekly 
        hack nights, which are <a href="http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/">every Wednesday night.</a> 
        We invite you to continue working with us here after National Day.
      </p>

      <h3>8:30 AM Breakfast</h3>
      <p>
        Doors open and breakfast provided!
      </p>
      <h3>9:00 AM Intro and keynote</h3>
      <p>
        Join the Code for San Francisco organizing team to kickoff the day. Megan Goering will set the tone with a keynote on human-centered design. We'll keep her messages in mind throughout the day as we dig deeper into the topic of community resiliency.
      </p>
      <h3>9:45 AM Community resiliency overview</h3>
      <p>
        Before the tabletop, <a href="http://empowersf.org/nenteam/">Daniel Homsey, NEN Director</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliciadjohnson/">Alicia Johnson, Resilience and Recovery Manager at SFDEM</a>, will give an overview the concept of resiliency and how the City's work relates to it.
      </p>
      <h3>10:15 AM Tabletop: immersive disaster response exercise</h3>
      <p>
          The Tabletop Exercise is a 90 minute immersive experience that allows you to plan and prepare your response in real-time with your neighbors and community. The exercise will be run by Daniel Homsey. Daniel will guide the participants through the scenario.</p> 
        <p>
          After this workshop, attendees should better understand their communityâ€™s needs post-disaster, recognize the value of teamwork in addressing those needs, and identify individual and collective investments to attain their internal and external disaster response goals. Ultimately, local stakeholder organizations across all sectors will form a higher level of connection with one another.
      </p>
      <h3>12:00 PM Break for lunch</h3>
      <p>
        Lunch will be provided
      </p>
      <h3>1:00 PM Tabletop debrief</h3>
      <p>
        After lunch, NEN invites people back to consider the challenges they and communities face and how technology could help. Participants will be able to debrief on the exercise and brainstorm on ways to volunteer support to these efforts.
      </p>
      <h3>2:00 PM Workshops and projects</h3>
      <p>
        Two workshops will be offered to help participants hone skills around human centered design and business model innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the workshops and after, participants are encouraged to take what they've learned from the day and convert it into action. Could be anything from prototyping and brainstorming and designing concepts to working on code. We don't expect everything to get solved in a couple of hours, but we'd love to see projects started and continued through Code for San Francisco's weekly hack nights.
      </p>
      <h3>5:00 PM Report out and wrap</h3>
      <p>
        What did we learn or work on today? We'll wrap the day with some report out from participants and next steps. Dinner will be provided after.
      </p>
      <h3>5:30 PM Dinner, celebration, networking</h3>
      <p>
        Let's celebrate the day by breaking bread together. Participants are welcome to continue working on things if they desire until we close, but there will be no more formal programming after dinner.
      </p>

        The <a
        href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-of-civic-hacking-2017">National
        Day of Civic Hacking</a> is an international event for people to
        focus on improving their community. Thousands of people from around the
        world will tackle civic-oriented projects around open data, disaster
        relief, mapping, safety and justice, economic development, and other
        topics.
      </p>

        <strong>Here in San Francisco,<strong> we are producing a jam-packed
        weekend focusing on how to stay resilient in the face of change. We
        encourage attendees to engage in making our city more resilient. There
        will be workshops on user research, human-centered design, technical
        spec'ing, and other activities designed to help a project be impactful.
      </p>

      <p>
        San Francisco faces risks on many fronts. Resiliency is measured in how
        well our institutions, communities, and infrastructure can weather
        hardships and even disasters. Earthquakes, sea level rise, droughts,
        blackouts, fires, floods, economic stress, and the housing crisis are
        just a few challenges that have tested our resilience in recent decades
        and can test us in the future. What fresh ideas and solutions can we
        develop this weekend through a human centered design process?
      </p>

      <h2>A Resilient City + National Day of Civic Hacking</h2>
      <p>
        In 1915, San Francisco put on a show for the whole world. The
        Panama-Pacific International Exposition showcased the leading innovations
        of the time from art to technology. More than 18 million people showed up
        to experience this world's fair. Also on showcase, just 9 years after the
        devastating 1906 earthquake, was San Francisco's remarkable recovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an historic reminder of San Francisco's resilience in the face of
        disaster. But throughout its history, the city by the bay has shown
        resilience in the face of all sorts of change, both human-made and
        natural.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this year's National Day of Civic Hacking, Code for San Francisco
        invites your participation in building a more resilient city. We
        believe a resilient city is one that is connected and prepared for
        uncertainty. The two day event will:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Showcase</strong> work being done to make San Francisco more resilient
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Encourage</strong> projects addressing challenges of
            resiliency through workshops in user research, human and
            community-centered design, technical spec'ing and other
            activities
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Foster</strong> collaboration around resiliency by bringing
            urbanists, civic hackers, developers, designers, marketers,
            students, government staff, and passionate residents together to
            connect, learn, and build tools that help the city in the face of
            change
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        While we don't expect 18 million people this year, in the spirit of the
        exposition over 100 years ago, let's show the world that this is
        a resilient city.
      </p>

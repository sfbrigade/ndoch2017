      <p>
        The <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic
          Hacking</a> is an international event for people to focus on
        improving their community. Thousands of people from around the world
        will tackle civic-oriented projects around open data, disaster relief,
        mapping, safety and justice, economic development, and other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Here in San Francisco,</strong> we will focus less on simple
        building projects like a normal hackathon and instead work to help our
        projects become more user-centered. Our 2-day event, organized by
        Code for San Francisco and designed by <a
          href="http://civicmakers.com/">CivicMakers</a>, will have workshops
        on user research, human-centered design, technical spec'ing, and
        other activities designed to help a project be impactful. Urbanists,
        civic hackers, developers, designers, marketers, students, government
        staff, and passionate residents will join together to ensure what we
        build is actually used by the people in our city.

      <h2>Human-Centered Design + National Day of Civic Hacking</h2>
      <p>
        Code for San Francisco has produced many projects over its 3 year life.
        However, we recognize that most did not have the impact we wanted,
        largely because we built <em>for</em> and not <em>with</em> people.
        With that in mind, we are undergoing a radical culture shift towards
        including our end users in our project concepting, design, development,
        and launch processes, all in service of creating greater
        <strong>impact</strong>.  This shift has been underway for the past few
        months, but will launch on this National Day of Civic Hacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        June 4-5 is not the culmination of our work to become more
        human-centered, but rather is the publicized beginning of our journey
        towards greater impact in the City in which we live, work, and play.
        This weekend will help National Day of Civic Hacking participants to
        understand why this journey is important, it will help them build their
        skills to journey smoothly, and it will help them help San Francisco
        effectively.

      contribute to making the weekend successful? We're looking for volunteers

      Maybe you're just curious? Just want to check this thing out without
      committing too much? Space is limited to 120 people, but tickets are
      transferable if you end up not being able to go. You can register and, if
      you find someone to take your place, transfer the ticket to them! We'd
      rather <strong>you</strong> show up, though ;)
